        "analysis": "The image is a line chart titled 'Daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases per million people,' sourced from Our World in Data. The chart displays the rolling 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases per million people across different continents: South America, Europe, North America, Africa, and Australia. The x-axis represents the timeline from January 1, 2020, to March 13, 2021, while the y-axis shows the number of daily new confirmed cases per million people, with options for linear and log scales.\n\n### Detailed Description of the Chart:\n- **Trends and Patterns:**\n  - **Europe:** Europe shows a significant increase in cases starting around October 2020, peaking in late November and early December, followed by a decline. A second peak is observed in early 2021.\n  - **South America:** South America experiences a steady rise in cases from April 2020, peaking around July, followed by a decline. A second wave emerges in late 2020, with a peak in early 2021.\n  - **North America:** North America shows a gradual increase in cases from April 2020, peaking in late November and early December, followed by a decline.\n  - **Africa and Australia:** Both continents have relatively low and stable case numbers compared to the others, with minor fluctuations.\n\n### Interpretation:\n- The chart highlights the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Europe and South America, aligning with the caption's reference to a 'new wave.' The peaks in late 2020 and early 2021 suggest a second wave of infections in these regions.\n- The data indicates that Europe and South America were significantly impacted by the second wave, while North America experienced a similar trend but with a less pronounced second peak.\n- Africa and Australia maintained lower case numbers, suggesting effective control measures or lower transmission rates.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The chart effectively communicates the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Europe and South America, emphasizing the challenges faced by these regions during the second wave. The data underscores the importance of continued vigilance and public health measures to mitigate the spread of the virus.\n\n### Confidence Justification:\n- The confidence score is 90 because the chart is clear, the data is well-organized, and the trends are easily identifiable. The caption aligns well with the data presented, providing context for the analysis. However, the score is not 100 due to the absence of specific numerical data points and the potential for regional variations within continents that are not captured in the chart."
