        "analysis": "1. **Content Analysis and Caption Alignment**: The image presents a statewide vaccine status for Ohio, focusing on the percentage of the population that has started their vaccine series. The caption claims that more than half of Ohioans are not vaccinated, which aligns with the data shown in the image.\n\n2. **Chart Description**: \n   - **Map**: The left side of the image displays a map of Ohio's counties, color-coded by the percentage of the population that has started their vaccine series. Darker shades indicate a higher percentage of vaccinated individuals.\n   - **Key Metrics**: The top section shows the total number of individuals who have started their vaccine series (5,789,597) and the percentage of the population this represents (49.53%).\n   - **Age Group Data**: A bar chart on the right breaks down the vaccinated population by age groups, showing that older age groups have higher vaccination rates (e.g., 80+ at 79.49%) compared to younger groups (e.g., 0-19 at 14.47%).\n   - **Daily Trends**: A line graph at the bottom shows daily vaccination counts, with peaks and troughs indicating fluctuations in daily vaccination rates.\n\n3. **Interpretation**: \n   - The chart clearly shows that 49.53% of Ohio's population has started their vaccine series, meaning that slightly more than half (50.47%) have not yet started. This supports the caption's claim.\n   - The age group data highlights a trend where older individuals are more likely to be vaccinated, while younger groups lag behind.\n   - The daily vaccination trend suggests variability in vaccination rates over time, possibly influenced by factors like vaccine availability or public health campaigns.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The image and caption together effectively communicate that a significant portion of Ohio's population remains unvaccinated, with notable disparities across age groups. The data supports the conclusion that more than half of Ohioans are not vaccinated.\n\n5. **Confidence Justification**: The confidence score is 90 because the data clearly supports the caption's claim, and the image is clear and unambiguous. However, a slight deduction is made due to the possibility of not having the most recent data or context about ongoing vaccination efforts."
