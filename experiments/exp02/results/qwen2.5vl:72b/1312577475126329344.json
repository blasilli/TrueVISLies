It reports 17 new COVID-19 cases, 7,266 recoveries, and no recent deaths. The visualization is a color-coded map of the Navajo Nation, showing the number of COVID-19 cases by region. The map uses a gradient from yellow to red to indicate the severity of cases, with red representing the highest number of cases. The map also includes a legend for the crude rate per 10,000 people. The accompanying text provides additional context, such as the total number of deaths and the number of tests administered. The message communicated is one of ongoing monitoring and reporting of COVID-19 cases within the Navajo Nation, emphasizing the number of recoveries and the lack of recent deaths.",
