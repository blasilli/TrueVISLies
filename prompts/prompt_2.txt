You are given an image that contains one or more visualizations and an accompanying caption.
The caption is: "<<CAPTION>>".

Be aware: The visualizations may be misleading, either intentionally or unintentionally. They might contain distortions, manipulations, or design choices that misrepresent the data.

Your task is to:
	1.	Analyze the content of the image and the caption.
	2.	Describe in detail what the visualizations represent. Identify axes, trends, patterns, categories, or notable data points.
	3.	Interpret the visualizations: What insights can be drawn? What is the likely message or conclusion the visualizations are communicating?
	4.	Provide your own conclusion based on your analysis.
	5.	Rate your confidence in your interpretation on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 means “not confident at all” and 100 means “completely confident.” Justify your confidence score (e.g., image clarity, ambiguity in data, alignment with caption, etc.).
	6.	Critically evaluate whether the visualizations may be misleading, either intentionally or by mistake. Justify your reasoning by referring to specific visual elements or design choices. Only consider the visualization misleading if your confidence in this judgment is high.
	7.	Identify also the types of visualization rhetoric used, if any. Use the definition of the five core types of visualization rhetoric provided at the end of this prompt. Remember that thare are five core types of visualization rhetoric: Information Access Rhetoric, Provenance Rhetoric, Mapping Rhetoric, Linguistic-Based Rhetoric, and Procedural Rhetoric. It is possible that none of these types apply to the visualizations you are analyzing. For each type you identify, provide the confidence in your judgment on a scale from 0 to 100, and a brief explanation of how it applies to the visualizations in question and if you think it supports the misleading aspects you identified in point 6.


Your response to point 6 must also populate the misleading_info field of the JSON output.
	-	Rate your confidence in your evaluation of the visualizations being misleading, on a scale from 0 to 100.
    -   Determine whether the misleading aspects are likely intentional or unintentional, and rate your confidence in this judgment on a scale from 0 to 100.
	-	Also include a list of misleading aspects as short sentences that summarize the elements that led you to think the visualization may be misleading.

Be thorough, clear, and precise in your explanation. Avoid vague statements.

Here is an overview of the five core types of visualization rhetoric: Information Access Rhetoric, Provenance Rhetoric, Mapping Rhetoric, Linguistic-Based Rhetoric, and Procedural Rhetoric.
	- Information Access Rhetoric: Refers to choices about what data to include, omit, filter, or aggregate. These choices shape what the viewer sees and which patterns or narratives are emphasized.
	- Provenance Rhetoric: Relates to how a visualization communicates trustworthiness, such as by citing sources, explaining methods, noting uncertainty, or including methodology or assumptions.
	- Mapping Rhetoric: Involves how data values are translated into visual features such as position, size, scale, metaphor, or color. This can create emphasis or shape perception beyond what the raw data conveys.
	- Linguistic-Based Rhetoric: Uses language elements like titles, labels, annotations, or captions to guide interpretation. Often includes metaphor, irony, rhetorical questions, or other narrative framing.
	- Procedural Rhetoric: Relates to interaction and navigation design, such as default views, filters, or animations. These features guide how users explore the data and can influence which conclusions they reach.
