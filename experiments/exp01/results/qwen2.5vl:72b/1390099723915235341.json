        "analysis": "The image contains a line chart titled 'Case Deltas from Press Conference to \"Official\" Totals.' The chart compares two datasets over time: 'Total Reported Cases' and 'Total Actual Cases.' The x-axis represents dates from March 15, 2020, to April 15, 2021, while the y-axis represents the number of cases, ranging from 0 to 1,000,000. The 'Total Reported Cases' are depicted by a white line, and the 'Total Actual Cases' are shown by a purple line, with the area between the lines filled in purple.\n\nThe chart shows a consistent upward trend in both lines, indicating an increase in the number of cases over time. However, the 'Total Actual Cases' line is consistently above the 'Total Reported Cases' line, suggesting that the actual number of cases is higher than the reported number. The gap between the two lines widens over time, especially from October 2020 onwards, indicating a growing discrepancy between reported and actual cases.\n\nThe caption mentions that 39,000 cases have been deleted by the state since last year, with 13,000 of them in the last 10 days. This information aligns with the chart's depiction of a discrepancy between reported and actual cases, suggesting that the state may have been underreporting cases or making adjustments to previously reported data.\n\nThe likely message of the chart is to highlight the difference between the cases reported by the state and the actual number of cases, emphasizing the importance of accurate data reporting. The widening gap between the two lines suggests that the discrepancy has been increasing over time, which could have significant implications for public health policies and resource allocation.\n\nBased on the analysis, it can be concluded that the state's reported case numbers may not fully reflect the actual number of cases, and recent adjustments to reported data have further widened this gap. The confidence score is 85 because the chart and caption provide clear and consistent information, but there is some ambiguity regarding the exact reasons for the discrepancies and the specific timeframe for the case deletions mentioned in the caption."
