        "analysis": "The image is a line chart titled 'COVID-19 DEATHS ACROSS EUROPE,' sourced from FT/ECDC. The chart illustrates the number of daily COVID-19 deaths in various European countries over time. The x-axis represents the number of days since the third consecutive daily death was first reported in each country, while the y-axis shows the number of deaths per day. The countries included are France, UK, Spain, Czech Republic, Belgium, and Sweden, each represented by a distinct colored line.\n\n### Trends and Patterns:\n- **Sweden's Line (White):** The line for Sweden remains consistently lower than the other countries throughout the period. It shows a gradual increase in deaths, peaking much later and at a lower level compared to the other countries. This suggests a different trajectory in the progression of COVID-19 deaths.\n- **Other Countries:** The lines for France, UK, Spain, Czech Republic, and Belgium show a more pronounced initial peak in deaths, followed by a decline. These countries experienced a higher number of deaths per day during the initial phase of the pandemic.\n\n### Insights and Interpretation:\n- The chart aligns with the caption 'Spot the country that didn\u2019t lockdown.' Sweden is known for its approach to the pandemic, which did not involve a strict lockdown compared to other European countries. The lower and later peak in deaths for Sweden, as shown in the chart, could be interpreted as a result of this different strategy.\n- The other countries, which implemented lockdowns, experienced higher initial peaks in deaths, possibly due to the rapid spread of the virus before lockdown measures were put in place.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, Sweden is the country that did not implement a strict lockdown, as indicated by the lower and later peak in COVID-19 deaths compared to the other countries in the chart. The chart effectively communicates the impact of different pandemic response strategies on the number of daily deaths.\n\n### Confidence Justification:\nMy confidence score is 90 because the chart clearly shows the difference in the trajectory of COVID-19 deaths between Sweden and the other countries, which aligns with the known information about Sweden's approach to the pandemic. However, the score is not 100 due to the potential for other factors influencing the data that are not accounted for in the chart, such as differences in testing rates or healthcare systems."
