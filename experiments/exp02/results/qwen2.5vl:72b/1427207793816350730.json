The first visualization is a bar chart showing the prevalence of the Delta variant in India and the percentage of fully vaccinated individuals. The Delta variant was 90% prevalent, but only 3% of the population was fully vaccinated. The second visualization is a scatter plot with a trend line showing an inverse correlation between the full vaccination rate and mutation frequency. The scatter plot includes data points for various countries, with India having a low vaccination rate and high mutation frequency, while countries with higher vaccination rates have lower mutation frequencies. The text and visualizations together suggest that higher vaccination rates suppress mutation frequency, contradicting the claim that vaccines induce variants.",
