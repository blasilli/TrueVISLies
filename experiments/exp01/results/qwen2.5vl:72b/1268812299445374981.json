        "analysis": "The image is a map of Kenya with accompanying data visualizing the spread of COVID-19 as of June 4, 2020. The map highlights the counties with confirmed cases, using red circles of varying sizes to represent the number of cases in each county. Larger circles indicate a higher number of confirmed cases. The data is sourced from the Ministry of Health and is presented by Nation Newsplex.\n\nKey data points include:\n- 87,698 people tested for COVID-19.\n- 2,340 confirmed cases.\n- 1,670 active cases.\n- 78 deaths.\n- 592 recovered.\n\nThe chart lists the number of confirmed cases by county, with Nairobi having the highest number (1,182 cases), followed by Mombasa (653 cases). Other counties with notable cases include Busia (110), Kajiado (88), and Kiambu (58). The remaining counties have fewer cases, with some having only a single confirmed case.\n\nInsights:\n- The majority of cases are concentrated in a few counties, particularly Nairobi and Mombasa, indicating potential hotspots for the virus.\n- The active cases are significantly lower than the confirmed cases, suggesting a high recovery rate or a high number of deaths.\n- The map provides a clear visual representation of the geographical distribution of the virus, helping to identify areas that may require more attention and resources.\n\nConclusion:\n- The chart effectively communicates the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya, highlighting the areas most affected and the overall impact of the virus. The data is presented in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for viewers to understand the situation.\n\nThe confidence score is 90 because the image is clear, the data is well-organized, and the caption aligns with the content. However, there is a slight ambiguity in the exact meaning of 'active cases' without further context, which slightly reduces the confidence."
