        "analysis": "The image is a line chart comparing the seven-day rolling average of new confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people in Paraguay and Brazil from December 2020 to April 2021. The x-axis represents the timeline from December 2020 to April 2021, while the y-axis shows the number of new cases per 100,000 people. Two lines represent the data for Paraguay (pink) and Brazil (blue).\n\n### Trends and Patterns:\n- **Paraguay (Pink Line):** The number of new cases in Paraguay shows a fluctuating trend. Initially, the cases were relatively low but started to rise sharply around February 2021. The peak is observed in late March 2021, after which there is a slight decline.\n- **Brazil (Blue Line):** Brazil's new cases also show a fluctuating trend. The cases were relatively stable at the beginning but started to increase around February 2021. The peak is observed in late March 2021, after which there is a significant decline.\n- **Comparison:** The chart shows that Paraguay's new cases per capita surpassed Brazil's in late March 2021. This is evident as the pink line crosses above the blue line around that time.\n\n### Insights:\n- The chart communicates that Paraguay experienced a more significant surge in COVID-19 cases per capita compared to Brazil in late March 2021.\n- The decline in cases for both countries after late March 2021 could indicate the effectiveness of measures taken to control the spread of the virus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the caption 'New Paraguay cases/capita are now greater than Brazil' is accurate. The chart clearly shows that Paraguay's new cases per capita surpassed Brazil's in late March 2021.\n\n### Confidence Justification:\nMy confidence score is 95 because the chart is clear, and the data aligns well with the caption. The crossing of the lines is a clear indicator of Paraguay's higher cases per capita. However, there is a slight ambiguity in the exact date when Paraguay's cases surpassed Brazil's, which is why the score is not 100."
