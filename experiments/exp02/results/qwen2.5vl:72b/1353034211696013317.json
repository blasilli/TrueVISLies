The graph shows two trends: 'Employees off work due to COVID-19' (blue line) and 'Active COVID-19 cases' (red line). The x-axis represents time, while the y-axis represents the number of cases or employees. The data points indicate that as of January 19, 2021, there were 72 employees off work due to COVID-19, 53 active cases, 12 lives lost, and 14 repeat infections. The report emphasizes staying safe and healthy with preventive measures like wearing masks, keeping distance, and maintaining cleanliness. The message is that VWSA is trending in the right direction despite the ongoing pandemic.",
