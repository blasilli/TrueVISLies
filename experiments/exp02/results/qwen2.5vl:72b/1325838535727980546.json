The top graph shows daily cases, a 7-day average, and a 14-day total per 100k population, with a target line indicating the desired 14-day total. The bottom graph shows daily deaths per million and a 7-day average. The data spans from late February to mid-October. Notable trends include a significant increase in cases and deaths starting in July, with a peak in October. The 14-day total per 100k is much higher than the target, indicating a concerning situation. The visualization aligns with the caption, which highlights Lubbock County's high 14-day COVID-19 positives. The message is that Lubbock County has experienced a severe COVID-19 outbreak, with a significant number of cases and deaths.",
