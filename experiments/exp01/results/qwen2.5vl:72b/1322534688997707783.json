        "analysis": "The image contains a line chart titled 'Daily new confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million people,' which compares the trends of Sweden and the European Union (EU) over time. The x-axis represents the timeline from February 19, 2020, to October 30, 2020, while the y-axis shows the number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million people, with a scale that can be toggled between linear and logarithmic. The chart uses two lines: a green line for the European Union and a red line for Sweden.\n\n### Trends and Patterns:\n- **Initial Phase (February to April 2020):** Both Sweden and the EU experienced a sharp increase in COVID-19 deaths. The EU's peak was higher than Sweden's, reaching approximately 8 deaths per million people, while Sweden's peak was around 6 deaths per million.\n- **Decline Phase (April to July 2020):** Both regions saw a significant decline in deaths, with the EU's decline being steeper. By July, both lines were close to zero deaths per million.\n- **Rebound Phase (August to October 2020):** The EU began to see a rise in deaths again, while Sweden's line remained relatively flat and close to zero.\n\n### Insights and Interpretation:\n- The chart illustrates that the trend of COVID-19 deaths was broadly similar across Europe, with both Sweden and the EU experiencing a peak, followed by a decline. However, the EU saw a more pronounced second wave in the latter part of the year, while Sweden did not.\n- The caption 'The trend is Europe-wide, broadly speaking' aligns with the chart's data, as both regions followed a similar pattern of increase and decrease in deaths.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the chart effectively communicates the trend of COVID-19 deaths in Europe, showing a common pattern of a peak followed by a decline, with a subsequent rise in the EU. The data supports the caption's statement about the Europe-wide trend.\n\n### Confidence Justification:\nThe confidence score is 85 because the chart is clear and the data is well-presented, aligning with the caption. However, there is a slight ambiguity in the exact reasons for the differences between Sweden and the EU, which could be due to various factors not explained in the chart."
