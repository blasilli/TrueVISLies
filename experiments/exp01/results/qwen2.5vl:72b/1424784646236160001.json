        "analysis": "The image contains a line chart titled 'Exhibit 2: Daily new cases and deaths (7-day moving average)' with the subtitle 'New cases continue to rise in the US.' The chart illustrates the trends of daily new COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States over time, from March 2020 to May 2021. The data source is Bloomberg, and the chart is attributed to BofA Global Research.\n\n### Axes and Data Representation:\n- **X-axis:** Represents the timeline from March 2020 to May 2021, marked at intervals of months.\n- **Y-axis (Left):** Represents the number of daily new cases, ranging from 0 to 300,000.\n- **Y-axis (Right):** Represents the number of daily new deaths, ranging from 0 to 4,000.\n- **Blue Line:** Indicates daily new cases.\n- **Light Blue Line:** Indicates daily new deaths.\n\n### Trends and Patterns:\n- **Daily New Cases:** The number of daily new cases shows significant fluctuations. There is a sharp rise in cases around April 2020, followed by a decline. Another peak occurs in January 2021, after which the cases decline again. However, there is a slight upward trend in cases towards May 2021, as noted in the subtitle.\n- **Daily New Deaths:** The trend in daily new deaths follows a similar pattern to the cases, with peaks in April 2020 and January 2021. The number of deaths also shows a decline after each peak, with a relatively low level of deaths in May 2021.\n\n### Insights and Interpretation:\n- The chart highlights the correlation between the number of daily new cases and deaths, indicating that periods with higher case numbers are also associated with higher death rates.\n- The data suggests that the US experienced two major waves of the pandemic, with the second wave being more severe in terms of both cases and deaths.\n- The slight increase in cases towards May 2021 could indicate a potential third wave or resurgence of the virus, which may warrant further attention and public health measures.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the chart effectively communicates the trends in daily new COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US over the specified period. The data underscores the impact of the pandemic and the importance of monitoring case numbers to prevent further waves of infections and deaths.\n\n### Confidence Justification:\nThe confidence score is 95 because the chart is clear, the data is well-organized, and the trends are easily identifiable. The alignment with the caption is strong, and there is minimal ambiguity in interpreting the data. The only slight uncertainty comes from the potential for external factors not represented in the chart that could influence the trends."
