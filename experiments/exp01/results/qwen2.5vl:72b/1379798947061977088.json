        "analysis": "The image contains a line graph titled 'COVID-19 in Ontario - Daily cases, deaths, & resolved.' The graph tracks the daily progression of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and resolved cases in Ontario over time. The x-axis represents the timeline, while the y-axis on the left measures new cases (infections/resolved), and the y-axis on the right measures new deaths. The graph uses three lines: a red line for new cases, a blue line for new deaths, and a green line for new resolved cases. \n\nThe graph shows a significant increase in new cases (red line) over time, with a sharp peak followed by a decline and then another rise. The new deaths (blue line) also show an increase but at a much slower rate compared to new cases. The new resolved cases (green line) follow a similar trend to new cases but with a slight delay. \n\nThe caption 'The gap between cases and deaths has never opened up like it has now' aligns with the graph, as the difference between the red and blue lines is visibly larger than in previous periods. This suggests that while the number of new cases has increased significantly, the number of new deaths has not increased at the same rate, possibly indicating improved treatment or other factors. \n\nThe likely message of the chart is to highlight the widening gap between new cases and new deaths, which could be due to various factors such as improved medical care, vaccination, or changes in reporting. \n\nMy conclusion is that the graph effectively illustrates the trend of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and resolved cases in Ontario, with a notable widening gap between cases and deaths. The confidence score is 85 because the graph is clear and the data is well-presented, but there is some ambiguity in the exact reasons for the widening gap, which could be influenced by various factors not shown in the graph."
