The x-axis represents the dates, while the y-axis represents the cumulative number of reported cases. The graph includes two lines: a solid line representing the actual cumulative cases and a dashed line representing the Gompertz model's prediction. The trend shows a slow increase in cases initially, followed by a sharp upward curve, indicating a rapid rise in cumulative cases. The Gompertz model closely follows the actual data, suggesting it is a good fit for the trend. The caption implies that while the model fits well, the results are not good, likely referring to the concerning increase in cases.",
