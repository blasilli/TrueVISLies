        "analysis": "The image contains a line chart titled 'Daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases per million people,' sourced from 'Our World in Data' and based on data from Johns Hopkins University CSSE. The chart compares the rolling 7-day average of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases per million people for three countries: Sweden, Norway, and Finland. The x-axis represents the timeline from March 1, 2020, to May 8, 2021, while the y-axis shows the number of daily new confirmed cases per million people, ranging from 0 to 700.\n\n### Trends and Patterns:\n- **Sweden**: Shows a significantly higher number of daily new confirmed cases compared to Norway and Finland. The peak occurs around November 2020, with over 700 cases per million people. After this peak, there is a sharp decline, followed by another rise in early 2021, which then decreases again.\n- **Norway and Finland**: Both countries exhibit much lower numbers of daily new confirmed cases compared to Sweden. Their trends are relatively similar, with minor peaks and troughs. The highest point for both countries is around 100 cases per million people, which is significantly lower than Sweden's peak.\n\n### Insights and Likely Message:\n- The chart highlights the stark difference in the number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases between Sweden and the other two Nordic countries. This could suggest that Sweden's approach to managing the pandemic, which was notably less restrictive compared to Norway and Finland, resulted in a higher number of cases.\n- The caption 'This debate is over, right?' implies a conclusion or resolution regarding the effectiveness of different pandemic strategies. Given the data, it suggests that the less restrictive approach taken by Sweden may have led to a higher burden of COVID-19 cases compared to the more stringent measures in Norway and Finland.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, it can be concluded that the chart supports the idea that the debate over the effectiveness of different pandemic strategies, particularly the less restrictive approach taken by Sweden, has been resolved in favor of more stringent measures, as evidenced by the significantly lower number of cases in Norway and Finland.\n\n### Confidence Justification:\nThe confidence score is 90 because the data is clear and the trends are distinct, making it straightforward to interpret the chart. The alignment with the caption is also strong, as the data supports the implied conclusion. However, the score is not 100 due to the inherent limitations of the data, such as the reliance on confirmed cases, which may not fully represent the actual number of infections, and the potential influence of other factors not accounted for in the chart."
