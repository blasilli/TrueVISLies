        "analysis": "The image contains a chart that visually represents the proportion of reported COVID-19 cases among fully vaccinated and not fully vaccinated individuals across various U.S. states. The chart uses circular segments to illustrate the percentage of cases attributed to each group. The dark purple segments represent cases among not fully vaccinated individuals, while the light orange segments represent cases among fully vaccinated individuals. The chart includes data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with each state's abbreviation and corresponding percentages displayed within the circles.\n\nKey observations from the chart include:\n- In every state, the majority of reported COVID-19 cases are among individuals who are not fully vaccinated. The percentages range from 94.1% in Arizona to 99.9% in Connecticut.\n- The light orange segments, representing fully vaccinated individuals, are consistently very small, indicating that breakthrough cases are a minor fraction of total cases in all states.\n- There is no significant variation in the trend across different states, as all states show a similar pattern with a dominant proportion of cases among the not fully vaccinated.\n\nThe likely message of the chart is that breakthrough cases among fully vaccinated individuals are not driving the surge in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Instead, the majority of cases are occurring among those who are not fully vaccinated. This conclusion is supported by the consistent pattern across all states, where the not fully vaccinated group accounts for the vast majority of reported cases.\n\nThe caption 'And that\u2019s the tea.' is a colloquial way of saying 'that's the truth' or 'that's the reality,' which aligns with the chart's message. The caption reinforces the chart's conclusion that breakthrough cases are not the primary driver of the COVID-19 surge.\n\nMy confidence in this interpretation is 95 because the chart is clear and the data is presented in a straightforward manner. The alignment between the chart's message and the caption further supports the interpretation. The only reason for not giving a perfect score is the slight possibility of misinterpreting the colloquial caption, although it aligns well with the chart's message."
