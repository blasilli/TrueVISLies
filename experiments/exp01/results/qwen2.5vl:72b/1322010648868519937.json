        "analysis": "The image contains two line charts that represent COVID-19 data for select U.S. states from March 12 to October 28. The left chart shows 'Daily Cases per Million People,' while the right chart displays 'Currently Hospitalized With COVID per Million People.' Both charts use the x-axis to represent time, from March 12 to October 28, and the y-axis to represent the respective metrics per million people.\n\n### Detailed Description of the Charts:\n\n**Left Chart (Daily Cases per Million People):**\n- The y-axis ranges from 0 to 1,400.\n- The x-axis represents the timeline from March 12 to October 28.\n- Data for Arizona, Florida, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin are plotted.\n- Notable peaks are labeled: Arizona (670), Florida (705), North Dakota (1,350), South Dakota (1,436), and Wisconsin (1,359).\n- Trends: Each state shows a significant spike in daily cases at different times. For example, Arizona and Florida peaked in July, while North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin peaked later, around October.\n\n**Right Chart (Currently Hospitalized With COVID per Million People):**\n- The y-axis ranges from 0 to 500.\n- The x-axis represents the timeline from March 12 to October 28.\n- Data for the same states are plotted.\n- Notable peaks are labeled: Arizona (483), Florida (443), North Dakota (373), South Dakota (466), and Wisconsin (247).\n- Trends: Similar to the daily cases, hospitalization rates also show peaks corresponding to the spikes in daily cases. However, the peaks in hospitalizations are generally lower in magnitude compared to daily cases.\n\n### Interpretation and Insights:\n\nThe charts illustrate the progression of COVID-19 in terms of daily cases and hospitalizations across the selected states. The data reveals that each state experienced a significant surge in cases and hospitalizations at different times, indicating the virus's unpredictable and regional impact. The peaks in daily cases are closely followed by increases in hospitalizations, suggesting a direct correlation between the two metrics. The later peaks in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin indicate a potential second wave or delayed spread of the virus in these regions.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption 'Where does this end, exactly?' aligns with the data, as the charts show ongoing fluctuations and peaks in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, with no clear endpoint. The data suggests that the pandemic's impact is prolonged and varies by region, raising questions about when and how it will conclude.\n\n### Confidence Justification:\n\nThe confidence score is 90 because the image is clear, the data is well-organized, and the trends are easily identifiable. The alignment with the caption is strong, as the data supports the ongoing nature of the pandemic. However, the score is not 100 due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting the future course of the pandemic based on historical data."
