        "analysis": "The image contains three line graphs, each representing the rolling average of new severe COVID-19 cases normalized to 1 million people, categorized by age groups: 40+, 40 to 60, and 60+. The x-axis represents the date, ranging from July 6, 2020, to July 27, 2020. The y-axis represents the rolling average of new severe cases per 1 million people. Each graph has two lines: one for 'unvax' (unvaccinated) and one for 'vax' (vaccinated) individuals. The 'unvax' line is consistently higher than the 'vax' line across all age groups, indicating that unvaccinated individuals have a higher rate of severe cases. The trend shows an increase in severe cases over time for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, but the increase is more pronounced for the unvaccinated. The graphs suggest that vaccination is effective in reducing the number of severe cases. The caption aligns with the visual data, confirming that the data is from Israel and is up to date.",
