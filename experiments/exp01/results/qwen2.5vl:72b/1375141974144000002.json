The accompanying caption suggests that India's second COVID-19 wave is expected to peak in mid-April and may infect 25 lakh (2.5 million) people, according to an SBI report.\n\n### 2. Description of the Chart\n- **Axes**: \n  - The x-axis represents the timeline from April 2020 to March 2021, marked in monthly intervals.\n  - The y-axis represents the number of new daily COVID-19 cases, ranging from 0 to 80,000.\n- **Trends and Patterns**: \n  - The chart shows a significant peak in daily cases around mid-September 2020, labeled as the '1st peak of Covid cases,' reaching approximately 80,000 cases per day.\n  - Following this peak, there is a noticeable decline in daily cases, with a reduction of almost 50% by the end of October 2020.\n  - From late February 2021 onwards, the chart indicates a sharp rise in daily cases, suggesting the onset of a possible second wave.\n- **Notable Data Points**: \n  - The highest point on the chart is around 80,000 daily cases in September 2020.\n  - The lowest point after the first peak is around 20,000 daily cases in October 2020.\n  - The chart ends in March 2021, with daily cases rising sharply, nearing 40,000.\n\n### 3. Interpretation of the Chart\n- The chart visually represents the first wave of COVID-19 in India, peaking in September 2020, followed by a decline. The recent sharp rise in cases from late February 2021 aligns with the caption's prediction of a second wave.\n- The SBI report's prediction of a peak in mid-April and 2.5 million infections is not directly shown on the chart but is supported by the upward trend in the data.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe chart effectively illustrates the trajectory of COVID-19 cases in India, highlighting the first wave and the emerging second wave. The upward trend in March 2021 supports the SBI report's prediction of a significant second wave. The data suggests that India may face a challenging period ahead in terms of managing the pandemic.\n\n### 5. Confidence Rating\nThe confidence rating is 85. The chart is clear and the data trends are well-defined, aligning with the caption's message. However, the exact prediction of 25 lakh infections and the peak timing are not directly represented in the chart, which slightly reduces the confidence level."
