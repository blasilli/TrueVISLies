You are given an image that contains one or more visualizations and an accompanying caption.

The caption is: "<<CAPTION>>".

Your task is to:
	1.	Analyze the content of the image and the caption.
	2.	Describe in detail what the visualizations represent. Identify axes, trends, patterns, categories, or notable data points.
	3.	Interpret the visualizations: What insights can be drawn? What is the likely message or conclusion the visualizations are communicating?
	4.	Provide your own conclusion based on your analysis.
	5.	Rate your confidence in your interpretation on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 means “not confident at all” and 100 means “completely confident.” Justify your confidence score (e.g., image clarity, ambiguity in data, alignment with caption, etc.).

Be thorough, clear, and precise in your explanation. Avoid vague statements.

Answer in JSON format, like this:
{
  "confidence": "numerical score from task point 5 goes here",
  "analysis": "your detailed analysis response (task points 1–5) goes here"
}

Do not include anything else other than the json object. Do not say '''json at the beginning.
