It reports 48 new cases of COVID-19, one additional death, and 1,585 recoveries. The visualization is a map of the Navajo Nation divided into service units, each shaded in a color corresponding to the number of COVID-19 cases per 1,000 population. The map includes a legend indicating the case rate per 1,000 people, with darker shades representing higher case rates. The accompanying text provides a breakdown of cases by service unit and summarizes the total number of cases, deaths, and recoveries. The map and text together aim to communicate the current status of the COVID-19 pandemic within the Navajo Nation.",
