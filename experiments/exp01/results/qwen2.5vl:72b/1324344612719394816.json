        "analysis": "The image is a line chart depicting the daily COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents for various U.S. states over time, from March 2020 to November 2020. The x-axis represents the timeline in months, while the y-axis shows the daily cases per 100,000 residents. Each state is represented by a distinct line with a unique color and pattern. The chart is divided into three waves of COVID-19 cases:\n\n1. **Wave 1**: This wave is labeled as 'NY tristate + MA + RI' and includes New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island. The peak of this wave occurs around April 2020, with New York showing the highest number of cases.\n2. **Wave 2**: This wave is labeled as 'F-CAT' and includes Florida, California, Arizona, and Texas. The peak of this wave occurs around July 2020, with Florida showing a significant increase in cases.\n3. **Wave 3**: This wave is labeled as 'spread out' and includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, and Nebraska. The peak of this wave occurs around October 2020, with North Dakota showing a sharp increase in cases.\n\nThe chart shows a clear pattern of three distinct waves of COVID-19 cases, each affecting different groups of states at different times. The first wave primarily affected the Northeastern states, the second wave affected the Southern and Western states, and the third wave affected the Midwestern and Mountain states. The chart also shows that the number of cases in each wave was higher than the previous wave, indicating a worsening of the pandemic over time.\n\nThe caption 'Covid cases via FS' likely refers to the source of the data, which could be a financial services company or a data provider. The chart effectively communicates the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and highlights the regional differences in the spread of the virus. The confidence score is 85 because the chart is clear and the data is well-organized, but the caption is somewhat ambiguous and does not provide enough context to fully understand the source of the data."
