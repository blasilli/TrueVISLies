The x-axis represents the timeline, while the y-axis represents the cumulative number of deaths, ranging from 0 to 800,000. The graph shows a steep upward trend, indicating a rapid increase in the number of deaths over time. The source is cited as the European CDC, and the graph includes a disclaimer about the limitations of testing and attribution of causes of death, suggesting that the data may not fully represent the true number of deaths. The caption links to a resource for more information about the pandemic. The visualization effectively communicates the severity and progression of the pandemic, emphasizing the increasing number of deaths over time.",
