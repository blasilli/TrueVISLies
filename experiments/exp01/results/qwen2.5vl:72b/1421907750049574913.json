        "analysis": "The image contains a line chart titled 'Daily new confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million people,' which compares the rolling 7-day average of COVID-19 deaths in the United States and Canada. The x-axis represents the timeline from March 1, 2020, to July 31, 2021, while the y-axis shows the number of deaths per million people, ranging from 0 to 10. The chart includes two lines: one for the United States (in blue) and one for Canada (in red).\n\n### Trends and Patterns:\n- **United States**: The U.S. line shows a significant peak around April 2020, reaching nearly 10 deaths per million people. There is a subsequent decline, followed by another peak around January 2021, which is slightly lower than the first peak. Afterward, the trend shows a gradual decline.\n- **Canada**: The Canadian line also shows a peak around April 2020, but it is lower than the U.S. peak, reaching approximately 6 deaths per million people. Canada experiences a second peak around January 2021, similar to the U.S., but at a lower level. The decline after the second peak is more pronounced in Canada compared to the U.S.\n\n### Insights:\n- Both countries experienced two major waves of COVID-19 deaths, with the first wave being more severe in terms of the number of deaths per million people.\n- The U.S. consistently had a higher number of deaths per million people compared to Canada throughout the period.\n- The second wave, while still significant, was less severe than the first wave in both countries.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe chart illustrates the impact of COVID-19 on mortality rates in the U.S. and Canada, highlighting the severity of the first wave and the subsequent decline in deaths. The U.S. experienced a higher burden of COVID-19 deaths compared to Canada. The chart effectively communicates the trends in COVID-19 mortality over time, providing a clear comparison between the two countries.\n\n### Confidence Justification:\nThe confidence score is 90 because the chart is clear, the data is well-presented, and the trends are easily identifiable. The caption 'And here' does not provide additional context but does not detract from the analysis. The only potential ambiguity lies in the exact reasons for the differences between the U.S. and Canada, which are not explained in the chart."
