        "analysis": "The image contains two line charts depicting the progression of COVID-19 in the United States. The first chart illustrates the seven-day rolling average of new confirmed cases, while the second chart shows the seven-day rolling average of new deaths attributed to COVID-19. Both charts use the number of days since a certain threshold of daily cases or deaths was first recorded as the x-axis.\n\n### Chart 1: New Confirmed Cases\n- **X-axis**: Number of days since 10 average daily cases were first recorded.\n- **Y-axis**: Seven-day rolling average of new cases.\n- **Trends**: The chart shows two distinct phases:\n  - Phase 1 (labeled '1'): An initial surge in cases, followed by a decline and a period of relative stability.\n  - Phase 2 (labeled '2'): A sharp increase in cases, indicating a second wave.\n\n### Chart 2: New Deaths\n- **X-axis**: Number of days since 3 average daily deaths were first recorded.\n- **Y-axis**: Seven-day rolling average of new deaths.\n- **Trends**: Similar to the cases chart, this chart also shows two phases:\n  - Phase 1 (labeled '1'): A steep rise in deaths, followed by a decline.\n  - Phase 2 (labeled '2'): A subsequent increase in deaths, though less pronounced than the initial surge.\n\n### Interpretation\nThe charts suggest that after an initial wave of COVID-19 cases and deaths, there was a period of relative control. However, the second wave, marked by a significant increase in both cases and deaths, indicates that the initial control was not sustained. This aligns with the caption's statement that the curve didn't stay flattened because states reopened without proper safeguards. The second wave's timing and magnitude suggest a correlation with the reopening of states.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe data supports the caption's claim that premature reopening without adequate safeguards likely contributed to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and deaths. The second wave's intensity underscores the importance of maintaining public health measures even as restrictions are eased.\n\n### Confidence Justification\nThe confidence score is 85 because the data clearly shows two distinct phases of the pandemic, with the second phase indicating a resurgence. The alignment with the caption is strong, and the trends are visually evident. However, the score is not 100 due to the inherent limitations of the data, such as not explicitly showing state-level reopening policies or other contributing factors."
