        "analysis": "The image is a line chart titled 'Daily new confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million people,' showing the rolling 7-day average for the United Kingdom and Sweden from March 1, 2020, to October 14, 2020. The x-axis represents the timeline from March 1, 2020, to October 14, 2020, while the y-axis represents the daily new confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million people, ranging from 0 to 12.\n\n### Description of the Chart:\n- **Trends and Patterns:**\n  - Both the United Kingdom and Sweden experienced a peak in daily new confirmed COVID-19 deaths around April 2020. The United Kingdom's peak was higher, reaching approximately 12 deaths per million people, while Sweden's peak was around 8 deaths per million people.\n  - After the initial peak, both countries saw a decline in daily new confirmed deaths, with the United Kingdom's decline being more pronounced.\n  - By October 14, 2020, the daily new confirmed deaths for both countries were at a low level, with Sweden showing a slightly higher rate than the United Kingdom.\n\n- **Notable Data Points:**\n  - The United Kingdom's peak in daily new confirmed deaths was around 12 per million people in April 2020.\n  - Sweden's peak was around 8 per million people in April 2020.\n  - By October 14, 2020, both countries had daily new confirmed deaths below 1 per million people.\n\n### Interpretation of the Chart:\n- The chart suggests that both the United Kingdom and Sweden experienced a significant first wave of COVID-19 deaths in April 2020, followed by a decline in deaths over the subsequent months.\n- The data does not show a significant second wave of deaths in either country by October 14, 2020, which aligns with the caption's statement about no Swedish second wave in deaths.\n- The chart does not provide information about ICU admissions or the broader impact on society and the economy, which are mentioned in the caption.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the chart supports the caption's claim that there was no significant second wave of COVID-19 deaths in Sweden by October 14, 2020. However, the chart does not provide information about ICU admissions or the broader societal and economic impact, which are also mentioned in the caption. Therefore, while the chart supports part of the caption's claim, it does not fully address all aspects of the statement.\n\n### Confidence Justification:\nMy confidence is rated at 85 because the chart clearly shows the trend of daily new confirmed COVID-19 deaths for both countries, supporting the part of the caption about no second wave in deaths. However, the chart does not provide information about ICU admissions or the broader societal and economic impact, which are also mentioned in the caption, leading to some uncertainty in fully supporting the caption's claim."
